      <p>The view you get from the top of Santa Maria de Lourdes is spectacular. All throughout the farm you will find small streams of water, separating the farm plots. From the Peralta familiy farms Santa Maria is always the last one to finish harvesting all its coffee, starting in January and going on all the way up until April. This is because at 1300 to 1550 mts, Santa Maria de Lourdes is the highest of all the Peralta farms.

        This higher altitude creates lower temperatures, especially at night, that make the cherries ripe more slowly to create more complexity. This just one of the reasons Santa Maria de Lourdes was awarded ‘Cup of Excellence’ several years in a row.

        Santa Maria de Lourdes, one of the two farms owned by Octavio Peralta, has 32 Ha of coffee area and an additional 45 Ha of forest area. This creates a unique eco system full of flora and fauna. Besides Caturra you will find Catuai, Tekisit, Maracaturra, Pacamara, Red Bourbon and Java growing here. Experienced farm manager Don Arnoldo has indicated that the Catuai growing here took 8 years to finally adapt to the unique micro-climate and soils. Now it has adapted it is one of the favorite varieties used for coffees with extremely good cup qualities.</p>
